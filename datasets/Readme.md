Datasets for testing and verification of the encoder and decoder.

This directory can be imported as python package that provides:
    1. CSV datasets
        Stored in subdirectories, each recorded from a real hardware device.
        These should provide a representative sample of the data library might be used for.
    2. Synthetic datasets
        Python coded data generators attempting to simulate typical or otherwise
        interesting data patterns that the library might encounter.
