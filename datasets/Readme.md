Datasets for testing and verification of the encoder and decoder.

This directory can be imported as python package that provides:
1. CSV datasets:
    Stored in subdirectories, each recorded from a real hardware device.
    These should provide a representative sample of the data library might be used for.
2. Synthetic datasets:
    Data generators implemented in python attempting to simulate typical or otherwise
    interesting data patterns that the library might encounter.
