List of things to check once we have a functional compression that can run on data.

- Compare predictors in actual use
    So far they have just been compared in an artificial test harness that
    should provide decent accuracy, but never in real compression scenario

- Verify adaptive exp golomb
    - Maybe figure out a better way to encode the quotient
        Current version uses elias gamma encoding that is 1 bit worse than unary on
        value 1, which is the target that the adaptation is trying to reach.
    - Verify the adaptation mechanism
